This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a potential memory corruption issue related to pointer arithmetic.  The `bug.c` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from improper handling of pointers, which can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.  The solution emphasizes safe pointer manipulation practices and defensive programming.
